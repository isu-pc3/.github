# ISU Physics Coding & Computation Collective (#PC3)

*An initiative dedicated to building strong computational skills among physics undergrads at Iowa State University.*
(NOTE: We are **not** an organization under the school, we are an independent group)


## 🎯 Mission 🎯

PC3 exists to aid undergraduate students in physics at Iowa State University in developing 
the programming, numerical modeling, and scientific-computing abilities essential for
research in physics and astronomy.

Students in PC3 will:

- Build competency in Python and scientific libraries
- Learn numerical methods used in physics research
- Collaborate on open-source computational physics projects
- Have a like-minded community to drive them further in programming


## 🧩 What We Work On 🧩

Our projects will span multiple areas of mathematics and physics, currently including:

- Unit conversion
- Numerical differentiation and integration
- Projectile motion simulation
- Modeling basic orbits
- Error propagation and basic data analysis
- LaTeX formatting conversion
